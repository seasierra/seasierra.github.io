            <h4>B2B blockchain-based movie licensing platform</h4>
          </header>
          <p>
            The client was a startup that was looking to build a
            platform for licensing movies to other companies. The platform would
            allow users to search for movies, view their details, and license
            them for various purposes. The project involved building the
            frontend of the platform using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, based on Vite framework.
            <br />
            My role was to implement features and ensure that the frontend was
            scalable, maintainable, and performant. I also worked closely with
            the backend team to integrate with their APIs and ensure that the
            data was being displayed correctly on the frontend.
            <bt />
            I have created components for common usage purposes to implement design system for faster and more efficient development.
            I also created a lot of reusable hooks to handle common tasks such as fetching data, handling errors, 
            and managing state with heavy use of types and generated rest schema.
            On many cases it required my own creativity to implement features which were not described in the design.
            <br />
            The project was completed on time with almost all root features implemented and within budget. 
            I mentored middle frontend developer to use my architectural solutions and left when my tasks were complete.

            Communication was a key part, payment flow builder was developed
            from scratch.

            take end-to-end responsibility for the quality and performance of
            the software product. The cooperation presupposed the extension of
            the existing functionalities of the application and the development
            of a frontend part. The application allowed trainers to create
            fitness-related content to sell it on the marketplace.
